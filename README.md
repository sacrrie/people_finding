# people_finding


This is the source code used for my project _Thermal Infrared Assisted Optical Pattern Recognition for Human Detection_
It is open for review purpose and sorry for the mess, proper refactoring is scheduled depend on changes in the future. Since this code works with specific hardware, detailed sharing guide will be added in the future.



In the future I will try to implement the system using C++
